# nProtect GameGuard Cleanup

This PowerShell script will use the common nProtect GameGuard paths and remove all .erl files.

You can download this repository by clicking the green code button in the upper right corner and then download zip.

Once downloaded I have this zip folder extracted to `C:\Tools` but you can extract anywhere. 

The PowerShell script can be run manually or you can import the XML file to Windows Task Scheduler which will create a reaccuring task every 30 minutes.
The time values can be changed easily after import in Task Scheduler.
